mFam-Contributions

Workflow to process tandem MS files and build MassBank records.Given the input metadata file along with raw MSP file(generated by MS-DIAL from raw abf files) .mFam Contributons functions include automated extraction of tandem MS spectra, spectrum cleanup,formula assignment to tandem MS fragments,SMILES,INCHI,INCHIKEY assignment from public database,recalibration of tandem MS spectra with assigned fragments,and extraction MassBank records.
